Email Headers Analyzer


*Title:* To evaluate discrepancies in 'received' fields between two headers and what do they indicate about mail relay path


---

## Aim
To analyze email headers and detect possible spoofing or malicious activity using Mail Header Analyzer.

---

## Requirements
- Mail Header Analyzer tool  
- Any email client (Gmail / Outlook / Yahoo) with suspicious email samples  

---

## Description
An email header contains routing information, including sender, recipient, subject, and most importantly, the path the email took across servers.  
Attackers often forge headers to trick recipients, called *email spoofing*.  

By analyzing headers, we can identify:  
- Real sender IP address  
- Authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Time delays between servers  
- Signs of spoofing / phishing

## Procedure — Steps to Analyze Email Headers

*Step-1:* First, get the email header. In Gmail, select the mail, click the three dots, and choose *Show Original*.

*Step-2:* After clicking *Show Original*, you will see the raw message with sender and receiver details.

*Step-3:* Use the *Mail Header Analyzer tool* for easy reading and analysis.

*Step-4:* Copy and paste the entire header text into the tool and click *Analyze Header*.

*Step-5:* Identify key header fields:  
- From  
- To  
- Subject  
- Date  
- Return-Path  
- Received  
- Message-ID  
- SPF / DKIM / DMARC

*Step-6:* Check for IP addresses and hostnames.  
- Use tools like *WHOIS* or online IP lookup services to identify the geographical location and ownership of IP addresses found in the Received lines.  
- Verify if any IPs are suspicious or if the hostname doesn’t match the expected sending server.

*Step-7:* Examine the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results:  
- *SPF (Sender Policy Framework):* Checks if the sender’s server/IP is authorized for that domain.  
- *DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):* Ensures the email content wasn’t changed.  
- *DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):* Provides domain-level email authentication, policy, and reporting.

- SPF Sender Policy Framework → Checks if the sender’s server/IP is allowed for that
domain
- DKIM DomainKeys Identified Mail → Ensures email content wasn’t changed.

## Expected Output
- The Mail Header Analyzer highlights key email header fields.  
- Authentication checks (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) show whether the email is genuine or spoofed.  
- Suspicious IP addresses or mismatched hostnames can be identified.  
- Email spoofing or phishing attempts are detected.
